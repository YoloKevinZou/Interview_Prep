1) What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it.

	My proudest achievement so far is the iOS application that I've built with my friends called "TaoMi" which is available for download on apple app store. TaoMi is an iOS application built with the goal to solve the problem of second hand product trading for chinese communities through United States. The reason why we chose iOS application to be our first platform was because majority of chinese people in the United States use iPhone over Android.
